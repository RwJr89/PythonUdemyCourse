# First create a variable called x and set it equal to any number
x = 50

# Next create a variable called y and set it equal to any number
y = 100

# Now, create a variable called z and set it equal to x + y
z = x + y

# Now overwrite the value of x with the value of z
x = 150

# Finally, print x to the screen using python's print function
print(x)
